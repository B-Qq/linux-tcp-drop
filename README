== Linux tcpdrop support ==

Module:
======
This module lets you drop TCP connections from 
working Linux system. It also supports unscheduling 
TIME_WAIT sockets.

The module creates pseudo-file /proc/net/tcp_drop
which expects input of the following format:

saddr:sport daddr:dport

Note: Spaces between the two can be of any type & size.

Requirements:
============

Linux kernel 3.0.0


Example1:
========

We have 4 connected sockets by IMAP client (port 143). Let's drop the last one:

netstat -n|grep ESTABLISHED|grep 143

tcp        0      0 10.31.1.141:51292       192.168.0.1:143        ESTABLISHED
tcp        0      0 10.31.1.141:51293       192.168.0.1:143        ESTABLISHED
tcp        0      0 10.31.1.141:51436       192.168.0.1:143        ESTABLISHED
                    ^.............copy this...............^

Just copy the middle part of string (incl. tabs/spaces) to /proc/net/tcp_drop:


echo "10.31.1.141:51436       192.168.0.1:143" > /proc/net/tcp_drop


Now it'dead:

netstat -neo|grep ESTABLISHED|grep 143
tcp        0      0 10.31.1.141:51292       192.168.0.1:143        ESTABLISHED
tcp        0      0 10.31.1.141:51293       192.168.0.1:143        ESTABLISHED


IMAP client has received a socket error & will reconnect when needed.

Example2:
========

Let's kill a TIME_WAIT socket.
I've just created a TIME_WAIT socket with a netcat connection to localhost:8080:

netstat -n|grep TIME_WAIT
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:34790         127.0.0.1:8080          TIME_WAIT
                    ^....................................^


Here's how to kill it (it's better to say 'unschedule'):

echo "127.0.0.1:34790         127.0.0.1:8080" > /proc/net/tcp_dro


Let's see:

netstat -neo|grep TIME_WAIT

<no one here>


What server/client code receives:
================================

All code which has been using the socket killed
receives network error (it's like receiving TCP RESET):

telnet localhost 8080
Trying ::1...
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Connection closed by foreign host.
